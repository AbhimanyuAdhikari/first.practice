"use strict"; //treats all js code as a newer version but nowadays it is automatic so no need to write it again and again

// alert(3+3) //can only be used in browser not in node js

let name = "Abhimanyu" //string data type and can be written in single quote too
let age = 20 //int datatype
let isLoggedIn = true // boolean datatype

let hello;//hello is undefined .. it is not 'null'

//null is a object in js
//null and undefined are two different types

console.log(typeof "Abhimanyu");//string
console.log(typeof null)//object
console.log(typeof undefined);//undefined
